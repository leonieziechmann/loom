# Getting Started

**Begin your journey with Loom.**

Welcome! This section guides you through setting up the Loom engine and building your first reactive component. By the end of this guide, you will have a working environment and a solid understanding of the basic syntax.

## Prerequisites

To use Loom, you need a working installation of **Typst**.

- **Typst CLI:** Version `0.14.0` or higher is required.
- **Editor:** We highly recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Tinymist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension for live preview and autocompletion.

## The Learning Path

We have broken down the setup process into two simple steps:

1.  **[Installation](./getting-started/installation)**
    Learn how to install the package and—more importantly—how to set up the **Wrapper Pattern** (`loom-wrapper.typ`) to keep your project clean.

2.  **[Your First Component](./getting-started/first-component)**
    Write your first piece of code. We will build a styled **Note Box** and learn the difference between standard functions and Loom Motifs.

## Why this setup?

Loom is not just a library of pre-made widgets; it is an _engine_ for building your own.
The setup might look slightly different from other packages (involving a `lib.typ` or wrapper file), but this architecture is crucial for enabling the "Time Travel" features that allow your components to communicate.

Ready? Let's get the engine running.
